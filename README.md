# 14D002---Deterministic-Models-and-Optimization

## Project Description

The problem: Sorting a given permuted array of a strictly ordered elements has complexity O(n^2) by using a naive approach. 
By using a divide and conquer approach complexity can be reduced to O(n log n).  
From the theoretical side the project covered a formal description of the problem, the algorithm and a complete proof of correctness. From the pseudo code we implemented both the naive and the efficient solution in R and compared the outcomes for both.
